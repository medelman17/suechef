# SueChef + Claude Desktop Example Workflows

Real-world examples of how to use SueChef with Claude Desktop for legal research and case management.

## üè† Premises Liability Case Workflow

**Scenario**: Water damage case against landlord, need to build timeline and find precedents.

### Step 1: Initial Case Setup
```
I'm starting a new premises liability case. Can you help me set up the case in SueChef?

Case details:
- Tenant: Jane Smith  
- Property: 123 Oak Street, Apartment 4B
- Landlord: ABC Property Management
- Issue: Ceiling leak causing water damage
- Initial incident: May 14, 2023
```

**Claude's Response**: Uses `add_event` to create initial timeline entry with proper legal context.

### Step 2: Timeline Development
```
Let's build a complete timeline. Add these additional events:

1. May 16, 2023: Tenant reports leak to property manager via email
2. May 18, 2023: Property manager acknowledges receipt, promises repair "soon"
3. June 1, 2023: No repairs made, tenant sends certified letter
4. June 15, 2023: Leak worsens, causing damage to tenant's furniture
5. July 1, 2023: Tenant withholds rent, cites habitability issues
```

**Claude's Response**: Uses multiple `add_event` calls with proper party identification and significance ranking.

### Step 3: Legal Research
```
Now let's research relevant precedents. Search for cases involving:
- Landlord duty to repair
- Notice requirements for habitability issues  
- Tenant remedies for water damage
- Rent withholding rights

Focus on California law if possible.
```

**Claude's Response**: Uses `search_courtlistener_opinions` and `unified_legal_search` to find relevant precedents.

### Step 4: Precedent Analysis
```
From the search results, import the most relevant 3-5 cases as legal snippets. For each one, create a snippet that captures:
- The key legal holding
- How it applies to our facts
- Whether it's binding or persuasive authority
```

**Claude's Response**: Uses `import_courtlistener_opinion` and `create_snippet` to build precedent database.

### Step 5: Strategy Development
```
Based on the timeline and precedents, analyze:
- What are our strongest legal arguments?
- What are potential weaknesses?
- What additional evidence should we gather?
- What are the likely damages we can recover?
```

**Claude's Response**: Uses `get_legal_analytics` and `temporal_legal_query` to provide strategic analysis.

## üìã Contract Review Workflow

Focus on recent Ninth Circuit decisions.
```

### Step 4: Comparative Case Analysis

## üîç Legal Research Deep Dive

- Regulatory developments (2016-2020)
- Recent enforcement and litigation (2021-2024)
```

### Step 4: Community Detection
```
Use SueChef's community detection to find related legal concepts and unexplored angles:
- What other employment law issues intersect with cryptocurrency?
- Are there patterns in how courts handle novel payment methods?
- What regulatory trends might affect this analysis?
```

### Step 5: Predictive Analysis
```
Based on the research, help me predict:
- How courts are likely to rule on this issue
- What regulatory changes might be coming
- How to advise clients considering cryptocurrency payments
- What compliance measures would be prudent
```

```

### Step 2: Precedent Analysis
```
Analyze our precedent usage:
- Which cases do we cite most frequently?
- Are we relying too heavily on older precedents?

```

### Step 3: Research Efficiency
```
Help us optimize our research process:

2. Searches for similar cases in our jurisdiction
3. Identifies relevant medical malpractice or product liability precedents
4. Sets up analytics tracking for case development
```

### Multi-Matter Management
